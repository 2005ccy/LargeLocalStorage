LargeLocalStorage
=================


## Problem: You need a large key-value store in the browser.  Making things worse, DOMStorage only gives you 5mb, Chrome doesn't let you store blobs in IndexedDB, Safari doesn't support IndexedDB, IE and Firefox both support IndexedDB but not the FilesystemAPI.
